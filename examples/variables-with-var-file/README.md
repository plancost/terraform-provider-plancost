# Variables with Var File Example

This example demonstrates how to explicitly pass a variable file to PlanCost.

It uses the `var_file` argument in the `plancost_estimate` resource to point to a specific variable file (e.g., `tf.tfvars`), which is useful when you have multiple variable files or non-standard naming.
