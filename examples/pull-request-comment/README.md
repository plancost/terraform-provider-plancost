# Pull Request Comment Example

This example demonstrates how to export the cost estimate to a Markdown file.

By using the `export_markdown_file` argument in the `plancost_estimate` resource, you can generate a `estimate.md` file. This file can then be used to post cost estimates as comments on Pull Requests in your CI/CD pipeline.
