# Usage Estimation with Exported Usage File Example

This example demonstrates how to export the usage schema for your resources.

By using the `export_usage_file` argument, PlanCost can generate a usage file (e.g., `usage.yaml`) containing all the estimatable usage parameters for the resources in your plan. This file can then be filled in to provide more accurate cost estimates.
