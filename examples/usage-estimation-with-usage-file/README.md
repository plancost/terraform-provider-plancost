# Usage Estimation with Usage File Example

This example demonstrates how to use an external usage file for cost estimation.

The `plancost_estimate` resource references a `usage.yaml` file using the `usage_file` argument. This file contains the usage parameters for the resources, allowing you to manage usage assumptions separately from your Terraform code.
