# Cost Guardrails Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `guardrail` block in the `plancost_estimate` resource to enforce cost budgets and policies.

It shows how to:
- Block execution when the estimated monthly cost exceeds a specific threshold.
- Issue warnings when the estimated cost increase exceeds a certain amount.
- Issue warnings when the estimated cost increase percentage exceeds a certain limit.
